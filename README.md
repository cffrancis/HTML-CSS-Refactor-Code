# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Summary

Using HTML, CSS, and GitHub starter code I took an existing code and refactored it to make it more accessible. For this assignment I refactored:

* A link to make it funcitonal.

*Consolidated CSS selectors and properties to make it more efficient.

* Organized CSS selectors and properties to follow the semantic of the HTML elements.

* Commented before and after each section to define the the section of the page.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Bugs

The only problem I had was making sure my html attributes aligned with my CSS correctly to retain the structure of the page. This took lots of trial and error.
